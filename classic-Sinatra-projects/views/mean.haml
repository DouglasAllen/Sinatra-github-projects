      &Mu; or mu = Mean Anomaly of the Sun
    %h3
      The Mean Anomaly of the Sun is a ficticious value based on an assmuption that the Earth's orbit is circular rather than eliptical and that the Earth's velocity is also constant.
      Mean Anomaly is used as a starting point to calculate the Eccentric Anomaly and the True Anomaly.
      We only need the mean anomaly to calculat the Equation of Center
      which will be used to calculate True Longitude which will be used to calculate Right Ascention. On the Main page you see mu and nu.
      But as you will see in the next page that the Equation of Center 
      is added to mu to get nu. We use Equation of Center again to calculate True Longitude which is not the same as lambda. Lambda is the mean longitude. So the Equation of Center gets canceled in the Equation of Time but we still need it for Right Ascension calculations.
    %h2
      These terms are calculated with the Universal Time Coordinate or GMT of the current time.
